## Q&A Preparation (3 minutes after presentation)

### Expected Questions & Answers:

**Q: How does this relate to the theme?**
A: "Chronoweave bridges tradition and trends by transforming ancient weaving—a slow, meditative craft—into fast-paced competitive gaming. Players learn about traditional patterns from cultures worldwide while experiencing modern gaming mechanics like speed runs, leaderboards, and character customization."

**Q: What was the hardest part?**
A: "Balancing authenticity with fun. I wanted to respect cultural heritage while making it exciting. The 70% accuracy threshold was key—it ensures players understand the patterns but can still move quickly. Also, implementing the 3D avatar system with Three.js was technically challenging."

**Q: How did you research the patterns?**
A: "I studied historical textile patterns from different cultures, focusing on authentic names and designs. Each pattern represents real weaving traditions—like Mesopotamian Royal patterns, Celtic Knots, and Aztec Sun designs."

**Q: Can you explain the coin system?**
A: "Players earn coins by completing challenges. The better you perform, the more coins you get. These coins unlock avatar customization items in the shop—44 different options including hair styles, accessories, and colors. This connects tradition (earning through cultural challenges) to trends (modern character customization)."

**Q: What makes it a website vs just a game?**
A: "Chronoweave is a multi-page web application with 7 different screens: registration, dashboard, three challenge types, avatar builder, and settings. All pages are connected with smooth navigation, and everything works together as a cohesive website experience."

**Q: How long did it take?**
A: "I spent [X weeks/hours] developing Chronoweave, including research, design, coding, and testing. The pattern creation took significant time to ensure cultural authenticity."

**Q: What would you add next?**
A: "I'd love to add multiplayer competition, more cultural patterns, a global leaderboard, and maybe even user-created patterns. I'd also expand the educational content with more detailed history for each culture."
